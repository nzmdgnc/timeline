<div style="color:#FFF"> CEO clients tell me all the time, "If I could "do it over again, I would have quickly evaluated "the team that I inherited, and made changes much faster." I'm going to share with you some ways you can efficiently assess your team so you don't find yourself making the same mistake. First, get to know your team members. You might be tempted to jump right into work, hold on just a minute.

        If you take the time now to get to know your people you'll have a much easier time evaluating them. Take the team out for lunch or agree to meet after work for Happy Hour. For virtual teams it might mean hosting virtual coffee breaks. The point is spend time with them. Also, be sure to hold regular team meetings. It's hard to assess how well someone works as part of a team without seeing them in action.
        
        You may want to have team members rotate who leads the meeting. This way you can sit back and watch the interactions. Next, conduct 360s for each team member. This means you gather anonymous feedback from the people who work around your employees. This approach gives you a more complete picture of each person. The results of this exercise will help you determine who on your team needs additional training or who you need to let go.
        
        Don't forget to trust your instincts. You know what you're looking for from your staff. If your gut tells you you've got the wrong person in the job then chances are you probably do. Finally, don't ignore the obvious. I once worked with a CEO who found the habits of his VP troublesome. She'd roam the halls texting and would never look up. Her behavior was off putting. He told her a number of times to knock it off and she never did.
        
        He knew and I knew she had to go. Eventually, he replaced her and the new VP has been a huge improvement. With any luck you're going to be living with this team for a long time. Put in the effort now to get to know them and set clear expectations and standards. And, don't forget to trust your instincts. The sooner you confirm you have the right team in place the better off you'll be.
